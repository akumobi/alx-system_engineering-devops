PROJECT BRIEF
This project has 20 tasks.
15 tasks (0-14) are mandatory and the remaining 5 tasks (15-19) are advanced.
All tasks are executable scripts except the last one which is a magic file.

TASK DESCRIPTION
Each task is described below;

TASK 0. Where am I?: 
This is a script that prints the absolute path name of the current working directory.

TASK 1. What’s in there?: 
This script displays the contents list of your current directory.

TASK 2. There is no place like home: 
This script changes the working directory to the user’s home directory.

TASK 3. The long format: 
This is a script that displays current directory contents in a long format.

TASK 4. Hidden files: 
Script to display current directory contents, including hidden files (starting with .). Use the long format.

TASK 5. I love numbers: 
This script allows the display of current directory contents in long format with user and group IDs displayed numerically and hidden files (starting with .)

TASK 6. Welcome: 
This is a script that creates a directory named my_first_directory in the /tmp/ directory.

TASK 7. Betty in my first directory: 
This script moves the file betty from /tmp/ to /tmp/my_first_directory.

TASK 8. Bye bye Betty: 
This script deletes the file betty from /tmp/my_first_directory.

TASK 9. Bye bye My first directory: 
This script deletes the directory my_first_directory that is in the /tmp directory.

TASK 10. Back to the future: 
This is a script that changes the working directory to the previous one.

TASK 11. Lists: 
This is  a script that lists all files (even ones with names beginning with a period character, which are normally hidden) in the current directory and the parent of the working directory and the /boot directory (in this order), in long format.

TASK 12. File type: 
This is a script that prints the type of the file named iamafile. The file iamafile will be in the /tmp directory when we will run the script.

TASK 13. We are symbols, and inhabit symbols: 
This script creates a symbolic link to /bin/ls, named __ls__. The symbolic link would be created in the current working directory.

TASK 14. Copy HTML files:
This script copies all the HTML files that have the extension .html from the current working directory to the parent of the working directory, but only copy files that did not exist in the parent of the working directory or were newer than the versions in the parent of the working directory.


TASK 15. Let’s move:
This is a script that moves all files beginning with an uppercase letter to the directory /tmp/u assuming that the directory /tmp/u will exist when we will run the script.

TASK 16. Clean Emacs:
This is a script that deletes all files in the current working directory that end with the character ~.

TASK 17. Tree: 
This script creates the directories welcome/, welcome/to/ and welcome/to/school in the current directory.

TASK 18. Life is a series of commas, not periods: 
This is a script that lists all the files and directories of the current directory, separated by commas (,). The directory names would end with a slash (/), files and directories starting with a dot (.) would be listed. The listing should be alpha ordered, except for the directories . and .. which should be listed at the very beginning and only digits and letters are used to sort; Digits would come first assuming that all the files we will test with will have at least one letter or one digit and the list would end with a new line.

TASK 19. File type: School: 
This is a magic file school.mgc that can be used with the command file to detect School data files. School data files always contain the string SCHOOL at offset 0.
